# jira-graph-viz
This project aims to provide a webapp that provides a graph visualization of jira queries using d3 with a python backend. It is still under construction!

To Do:
- change link to ticket to text
- remove text for issuetype
- change shape of node by issuetype (use square, rect, diamond?, circle (big, small), oval, custom shape?)
- modal on mouseover of node - show data pulled in by sprintquery
- change default nodes shown to just nodes in query
- onclick of node - add linked nodes to graph / remove linked nodes from graph (but not linked nodes in query)
