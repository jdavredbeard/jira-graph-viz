# jira-graph-viz
This project aims to provide a webapp that provides a graph visualization of jira queries using d3 with a python backend. It is still under construction!

To view the project, just open index.html in your browser. There are no dependencies to download. 

To Do:
- visually encode issuetype with shape of nodes (square, circle, triangle, pentagon, etc)
- modal on mouseover of node - show data pulled in by sprintquery
- onclick of node - add linked nodes to graph / remove linked nodes from graph (but not linked nodes in query)
- create endpoint for frontend to hit to run query
